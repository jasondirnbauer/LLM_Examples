    "Remember yesterday when we shared The Information’s whispers about OpenAI building spreadsheet and PowerPoint generators? Turns out, they were thinking WAY bigger.\n",
    "\n",
    "Instead, OpenAI released ChatGPT Agent. This agent combines Operator, Deep Research, and good ole ChatGPT to browse the web, write code, book flights, and even make phone calls on your behalf (example).\n",

    "\n",
    "Our take: OpenAI agent, and by extension, this next wave of do-it-all agents, is the beginning of America’s super-app era. There’s a reason GenSpark’s agent is called “Super Agent.” Because the more these AI can do for you, the less you’ll be reliant on other software applications. And whatever OpenAI plans to do with its upcoming browser Aura and GPT 5 is essentially the next step of that.\n",
    "\n",
    "Speaking of GPT-5, TBH Agent feels like what we imagined the “unified” experience of GPT-5 would be. So imagine Agent + a smarter model + a new, more AI friendly browser, and we basically have the GPT-5 that was promised, right?\n",
